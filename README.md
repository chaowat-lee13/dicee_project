# dicee_project

This project contains HTML, CSS and Javascript code.

Especially Javascript code, I use HTML DOM queryselector to work as functions and also if-else statement(conditional statements) to make dicee game work properly.

It is a simple game which has 2 players, each player has their own dice.

To play this game is just to refresh the page or F5. The winner is the one who has greater score on their dice.
